        "##Problem Statement - Most of the RAG workflows sometimes do not provide context based information. They usually go off context while using RAG or if there are not able to retrieve the embeddings they just cipher off and might not give any information at all leaving the user unsatisfied.\n",
        "## Solution - The inherent problem with this is that the embeddings stored in the vector database do not have context related to the document that is being processed itself. Example apple's filings could be stored in a VDB but the context stored in the vdb could still be \"apple\" as in fruit. Thus when the user\n",
